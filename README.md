# Intelligent-Cardiac-Disease-Detection-using-ML-Algorithm
  Heart-related diseases remain one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality across the
globe. With increasing stress levels, sedentary lifestyles, poor dietary habits, and a rise in conditions like
hypertension and diabetes, the incidence of cardiac diseases has grown significantly in recent years. As a
result, early detection and timely intervention have become critical factors in improving patient outcomes
and minimizing the long-term impact of these conditions. However, traditional diagnostic methods,
though effective, often depend heavily on clinician expertise and may not always provide real-time
predictive insights, especially in critical care settings.
  The study aims to develop a Cardiac Machine Learning Model (CMLM) designed specifically for
deployment in the CICU. This model will process real-time data and help medical professionals detect
early signs of cardiac diseases with greater precision. To create this model, the research involves the
collection and analysis of physiological parameters such as heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation
levels, respiratory rate, and electrocardiogram (ECG) readings. These parameters serve as vital indicators
of a patient’s cardiac health and, when analyzed in combination, can reveal subtle patterns or anomalies
that may precede a cardiac event.
  For the predictive modeling aspect, several statistical and machine learning techniques were
considered, including logistic regression, support vector machines, random forests, and neural networks.
Among these, the decision tree model demonstrated the highest accuracy in identifying potential cardiac
events. Decision trees offer clear interpretability, making them a preferred choice in clinical settings
where transparency and explainability of predictions are crucial. The model’s ability to handle both
numerical and categorical data and its robustness against missing values further contributes to its
effectiveness. The proposed decision tree-based CMLM is expected to significantly improve early
detection and intervention in the CICU by continuously monitoring patient data.
